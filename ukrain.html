                <h1>Cultural milieu</h1>
                <p>Ukraine possesses a wealth of cultural talent and a considerable cultural legacy. Numerous writers have contributed to the country’s rich literary history. Impressive monuments of architecture and museums displaying works by generations of Ukrainian artists can be found throughout the country, and art galleries featuring contemporary Ukrainian artists have become commonplace in larger urban centres. The country’s strong tradition of folk art also continues to this day. In addition, high-calibre performing artists and ensembles appear regularly in Ukraine’s numerous theatres and concert halls.

                    Because of the country’s geographical location, Ukrainian culture has been influenced by the cultures of both western Europe and Russia. Although these influences are particularly evident in the western and eastern halves of the country, respectively, there is no strict geographical division. For example, Russian is spoken in the streets and in many homes and institutions throughout the country; it also is used in national publications, radio broadcasts, and popular music. The country’s other ethnic minorities contribute to a measure of cultural diversity as well.

                <h1>Religion</h1>
                <p>Christianity is the dominant religion, represented by the
                    Ukrainian Orthodox Church (84 percent of the population),
                    Greek Catholic (Uniate) Church (which combines Orthodox
                    rituals with recognition of the Catholic pope, 8 percent), and
                    the Roman Catholic Church (2 percent). The Ukrainian
                    Orthodox Church split from its parent Orthodox Church in
                    Russia in 1992; it has no official status. Catholicism is found
                    mostly in the west. Communism encouraged people to
                    abandon their religious beliefs, but many Ukrainians
                    maintained their devout heritage. So once religious freedom
                    was restored in the late 1980s, Christianity began to revive.
                    The trend intensified with independence, and today Christians
                    also include small but growing groups of Protestants (2
                    percent) and other denominations. Jews now represent less
                    than 1 percent of the population, but their numbers were
                    much higher prior to World War II. Ukraine is home to many
                    sacred Jewish sites.</p>

                <h1>Family</h1>
                <p>The family unit is important in Ukraine, and extended family
                    ties are valued. The average family has one or two children.
                    Couples generally make most family decisions together. In
                    urban families, both parents usually work outside the home.
                    In rural areas, it is more common for women not to work
                    outside the home. Women are generally responsible for
                    household chores, whether they work outside the home or not.
                    In recent years, more women have held important posts in
                    business and government (most notably former prime
                    minister Yulia Tymoshenko). However, most of the highest
                    positions are still held by men, and the average woman may
                    find it difficult to break into higher levels of employment.
                         Because of the high cost of housing, most young people
                    live with their parents. Children usually do not move out until
                    they get married, although some young couples continue to
                    live with one set of parents even after marriage until they can
                    afford a place of their own. Young people who attend
                    universities away from their hometown usually live in
                    dormitories. After graduation, most move back in with their
                    parents until they can afford to move out.
                         The elderly are treated with love and respect. Many elderly
                    parents live with their adult children, and grandparents often
                    assume responsibility for daily child care. It is a common
                    practice for parents to support children until they reach
                    adulthood and even after they are married. In turn, children
                    care for aging parents when it becomes necessary. When
                    grandparents live in the country and adult children live in the
                    city, the grandchildren may be sent to live with the
                    grandparents for several weeks during the summer. In some
                    cases, adult children living in urban areas may also return to
                    rural areas during the spring and fall to help their parents
                    plant and harvest crops.

                <h1>Dating and Marriage</h1>
                <p>Ukrainians start dating in their early teens. Young Ukrainians
                    meet at discos and concerts, in school, at work, and through
                    friends. When dating, they usually visit friends, go to bars or
                    movies, or dance at discos. Couples usually marry in their
                    twenties. Couples may date for an extended period of time
                    without getting married, and a sexual relationship does not
                    necessarily lead to marriage. A growing number of couples
                    choose to live together before or instead of marrying. People
                    in rural areas are generally more conservative, and sexual
                    relationships outside of marriage, while not uncommon, are
                    cause for gossip.
                         In order for a couple to become engaged, the man is
                    expected to ask the woman's parents for permission to marry
                    her. Traditionally, he would not ask himself. Instead, he
                    would bring a close friend or relative with him to speak with
                    her parents. This person would present the man in a positive
                    light and attempt to persuade the woman's parents about the
                    quality of the match. Today, most men speak to the woman's
                    parents themselves. If the parents agree to the engagement,
                    the man is free to propose to the woman. While most men
                    seek permission from the woman's parents, today this ritual is
                    generally seen as ceremonial. The decision is generally
                    viewed as the couple's to make, and family approval is not
                    considered as important as in past generations. Engagements
                    generally last from three months to a year.
                         A marriage is legal only if performed in a city hall or in a
                    “wedding palace” (an elegant building with several rooms
